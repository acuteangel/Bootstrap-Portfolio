# Bootstrap-Portfolio

I was able to build my webpage using a majority of bootstrap but required a CSS stylesheet to make a few changes. There were some minor things such as adding in my background image and changing the teal to be the one used before. I also changed the spacing for the main header in order to neatly fit my name and its background in the header. I also used css to fix the border for the footer and to add a hover effect to the navigation links in the header. 

The one major fix I used CSS for was for getting the title over my Portfolio gallery items. While I was able to find ways to get a caption to overlay an image with Bootstrap, none of these ways worked when I tried to add a box which would span the width of the image. Instead I used the same coding from my Basic Portfolio which overlayed the text on top of the image. There was an issue with getting the text's box to properly fit the image so I had to force the width for most sizes. Because this box wasn't responsive the same way the image was, I have the title moved below the image when the screen width goes below 576px.
